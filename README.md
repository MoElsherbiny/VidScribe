## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Converts speech into text using Google Speech Recognition.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Transcribes audio into both English and Arabic.
- **Subtitle Generation**: Outputs subtitles in `.srt` format with precise timestamps.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple video files from a specified directory.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Implements retry mechanisms and logs progress.
- **Custom Chunk Duration**: Splits audio into manageable segments for better accuracy.

## üíª Understanding Virtual Machines (VMs)

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system independently of the host machine.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Using a Virtual Machine:

- **Isolation**: Runs applications in a sandboxed environment, preventing conflicts with system files.
- **Portability**: Can be easily moved between different machines or cloud environments.
- **Multiple OS Support**: Allows running Windows, Linux, or macOS on a single device.
- **Development & Testing**: Ideal for testing software in different environments without modifying the host OS.
- **Security**: Provides a secure space to execute potentially harmful programs.

Using a VM for VidScribe ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, avoiding dependency conflicts that may arise on different operating systems.

## üõ† Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Before installing VidScribe, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+** installed. Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **FFmpeg** installed and added to your system PATH. Download it from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

To verify your installation, run:

```sh
python --version
ffmpeg -version
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoElsherbiny/VidScribe.git
cd VidScribe
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for this project, preventing conflicts with system-wide packages.

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
source venv/Scripts/activate    # For Windows
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, manually install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy decorator imageio imageio-ffmpeg moviepy SpeechRecognition pydub
```

## üìå Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

To start VidScribe, execute the following command:

```sh
python vidscribe.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a directory containing video files. If no path is provided, it defaults to:

```
D:\VIDSCRIBE
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Video Files

VidScribe will automatically:

‚úÖ Extract audio from video files\
‚úÖ Split audio into 30-second chunks\
‚úÖ Transcribe each chunk into English and Arabic\
‚úÖ Generate subtitles with timestamps\
‚úÖ Save transcripts in the `transcripts/` folder

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Output Files

For each video file, the following output files are generated:

- **`video_name_en.srt`** ‚Üí English subtitles
- **`video_name_ar.srt`** ‚Üí Arabic subtitles
- **`video_name_en.txt`** ‚Üí Plain text transcript (English)
- **`video_name_ar.txt`** ‚Üí Plain text transcript (Arabic)

## üìÇ Example Output Structure

```
transcripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_en.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_ar.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_en.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_ar.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2_en.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2_ar.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2_en.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video2_ar.txt
```

## üìù Code Explanation

VidScribe consists of several key components:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Audio Extraction (FFmpeg)**

The script extracts audio from video files using FFmpeg:

```python
subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-i", video_path, "-q:a", "0", "-map", "a", audio_path])
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Audio Splitting**

Since speech recognition works better with smaller segments, the script divides audio into 30-second chunks:

```python
chunk = audio[start_time:end_time]
chunk.export(chunk_path, format="wav")
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Speech Recognition**

Google Speech Recognition API is used to transcribe the chunks:

```python
text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language="en")
```

For Arabic transcription:

```python
text_ar = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language="ar")
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Subtitle Generation**

Each transcribed text is converted into an SRT subtitle format:

```python
subtitle_file.write(f"{index}\n{start} --> {end}\n{text}\n\n")
```

---

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ FFmpeg Not Found

Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH:

- **Windows**: Add the FFmpeg `bin` folder to `Environment Variables > System PATH`.
- **Mac/Linux**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors, try running the script with administrative privileges:

```sh
sudo python vidscribe.py  # Mac/Linux
python vidscribe.py       # Windows (Run as Administrator)
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Dependencies

Reinstall dependencies:

```sh
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
