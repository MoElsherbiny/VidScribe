## üíª Understanding Virtual Machines (VMs)

A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system independently of the host machine.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Using a Virtual Machine:

- **Isolation**: Runs applications in a sandboxed environment, preventing conflicts with system files.
- **Portability**: Can be easily moved between different machines or cloud environments.
- **Multiple OS Support**: Allows running Windows, Linux, or macOS on a single device.
- **Development & Testing**: Ideal for testing software in different environments without modifying the host OS.
- **Security**: Provides a secure space to execute potentially harmful programs.

Using a VM for VidScribe ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, avoiding dependency conflicts that may arise on different operating systems.

```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for this project, preventing conflicts with system-wide packages.

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
source venv/Scripts/activate    # For Windows
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

## üîê Setting Up a Verified GPG Key

To sign your commits and verify them on GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a GPG Key

```sh
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Choose:

- **RSA and RSA (default)**
- **4096-bit key size**
- **Key valid for: 0 (does not expire)**
- **Your name and email (must match your GitHub email)**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ List Your GPG Keys

```sh
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

Copy the **long key ID** (e.g., `0000000000000`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Git to Use Your Key

```sh
git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_KEY_ID>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Export and Add Key to GitHub

```sh
gpg --armor --export <YOUR_KEY_ID>
```

Copy the output and add it to [GitHub GPG Keys](https://github.com/settings/gpg-keys).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test Signing a Commit

```sh
git commit -S -m "Test commit with GPG"
git push
```

Your commits should now be verified on GitHub!

- **`video_name_ar.srt`** ‚Üí Arabic subtitles
- **`video_name_en.txt`** ‚Üí Plain text transcript (English)
- **`video_name_ar.txt`** ‚Üí Plain text transcript (Arabic)

## üìÇ Example Output Structure

```
transcripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_en.srt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1_ar.srt
